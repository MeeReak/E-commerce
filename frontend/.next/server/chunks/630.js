The botanical classification is based on the plant’s physiological characteristics, like its structure, function and organisation.1 A botanical fruit has at least one seed and grows from the flower of the plant. Examples of botanical fruits include apples, strawberries, peaches, but also tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers. A botanical vegetable, on the other hand, does not have a set definition but is more of a general term encompassing all other edible aspects of the plant, the roots, the stems and the leaves. Examples include foods such as spinach, broccoli and carrots.",des2:"The culinary classification is based on the way the plants are used and their flavour profiles. Culinary fruits have a softer texture, tend to be either sweet or tart and are often enjoyed raw or in desserts or jams. In contrast, a culinary vegetable usually has a tougher texture, blander taste and often requires cooking. The culinary classification may be more useful in our day-to-day lives as foods from the same botanical family may not have the same nutritional composition. For example, cantaloupe melons, watermelons, butternut squash, cucumbers and pumpkins all belong to the same botanical family but have different nutritional values.",des3:"Eating a lot of fruits and vegetables is strongly associated with a lower risk of premature deaths and non-communicable diseases; particularly, cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease and stroke, and certain cancers i.e., of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus and colorectum.6-8 A meta-analysis looking at 95 prospective studies found that each additional 200 grams of fruits and vegetables per day was associated with an 8% lower risk of coronary heart disease, 16% lower risk of stroke, 8% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, 3% lower risk of cancer and 10% lower risk of premature death.9",images:["https://images-prod.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/AN_images/is-avocado-a-fruit-or-a-vegetable-1296x728-feature.jpg","https://i0.wp.com/images-prod.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/AN_images/variety-of-vegetables-on-chopping-board-11296x728.jpg?w=1575"],comments:[{name:"Srey Chantha",avatar:"https://cdn.vuetifyjs.com/images/lists/1.jpg",comment:"I love fruit in general, but my favorite is banana.

White meat includes poultry, like chicken and turkey, which is lighter in color and generally lower in fat compared to red meat. Processed meats, such as bacon, sausages, and ham, are those that have been preserved or altered through smoking, curing, or other methods for enhanced flavor and longevity.
